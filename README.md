[Here's an Article](https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/using-viper-architecture-android/) that I've wrote about this subject, feel free to drop some comments!

## Presets
On the folder `Presets` there are files for each kind of file that a VIPER module needs.
<br>To add these presets to your Android Studio, just go:
`Preferences > Editor > File and Code Templates > Files`
